      A site that I encountered and really liked is
      <a href="https://2019.makemepulse.com">2019.makemepulse.com</a>. This site
      has a peaceful and tender narrative but still leaves room for the audience
      to play around with. I notice that the music in this site reaqlly helped
      to set the setting of the narrative in. I want to use this type of music
      in my story.

      One thing that I like right away from the homepage is the stylized "Start"
      button. It fits with the drawing, and makes it belong to the story.
      Buttons are important because they make the story go forward, hence having
      customized buttons that don't break the aesthethic flow of the story is
      needed. I also like the customized cursor, so simple but adds
      characteristic.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I like about this second page is the dialogue box. I think this type
      of box style might fit with my content. Something that looks historical
      and simple, like the era back then.

      This page is where I'm dragging the flowers up using my cursor. This
      interactive element allows the audience to play around and stay on the
      page longer to explore. I really want to use this type of interaction in
      my project. Another thing that I like about this page is that when you
      click the "Next" button, the screen goes up. It feels different from the
      way we usually constructs stories.

      The still image of this screen doesn't show it, but there are different
      layers of elements here which makes it feel very dimensional. It makes me
      feel like I teleported into a different world. This inspires me to use
      some sort of layers in my project. There are subtle movements here too
      which I also want to use in my project.

      The site that I just visited is
      <a href="https://www.qaisar.design">www.qaisar.design</a>. What I really
      like about this site is that it's so interactive, it makes me keep wanting
      to scroll down.
    </p>
    <img src="images/qaisar-01.png" alt="" width="800" />
    <p>
      Upon entering the homepage, I see a really dynamic layout with different
      type hierarchy, an illustration and colors. These elements combined
      together make the page dynamic. The cursor is also in the shape of a
      circle and extends to an oval when you move around. I find that pretty
      cool
    </p>
    <br />
    <img src="images/qaisar-02.png" alt="" width="800" />
    <p>
      I like how at this part the cursor turns into a blob of circle and has an
      illustrations when hovered over each award. And each blob has a different
      color as well.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      This page is there play he displays his work. I find it cool that each
      work is like window, and when I hovered over each window, my cursor turns
      into the orange blob. I can use this blob to move behind the white text,
      so I can read better. I find it really intriguing to me because it makes
      me interact with the text.
    </p>

      The words outlined are like playing in a slideshow, they keep on moving to
      the left. I find them neat because they contrast the text at the bottom.
      The arrows to the right is animated, and it's pointing to the email icon.
      It's a really nice touch to end the page. I really like this site overall,
      so playful and interactive. It for sure shows the personality and skills
      of the developer!

    <p>
      The first site that I want to redo is
      <a href="www.cocodonuts.com">Coco Donuts</a>. Recently, I've been liking
      donuts more which is how I came across to this site. The current site is
      not bad, but I definitely think it can be more engaging. Given that donuts
      is something sweet and provokes good feelings, the site can be a bit more
      playful.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to redo this site, I would want to make a
      <strong>spinning mochi donut</strong> within the loading screen. I want to
      make the homepage more appealing, maybe have a side nav to the left to
      break it away from its usual convention. The homepage will have
      information about one special donut of the month. If you hover it, it will
      pop up information about itself. As you scroll down, you will get to the
      "Donut" page where there are more donuts presented. The donuts will have a
      picture, name, & price. I want a faint gradient to appear under these
      donut boxes when they're hovered over. Also, as you scroll down, it
      updates on the nav bar too. For example, if the person scrolls down to the
      "Coffee" section, the "Coffee" section in the nav bar will be highlighted.
      Two other pages that I will do would be the "Coffee" and the "Locations &
      Hours" pages.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second site that I would consider redoing is
      <a href="www.twozonechickennwor.com">Two Zone Chicken NW</a>. The reason
      that I wanted to redo this site is because it's underwhelming. Their food
      looks way too good to have a site that couldnt' show the charm of their
      food. I feel like the site just feels very default. Although I'm no
      expert, but I'm confident that I can design a site better than what
      currently have right now because it is that underwhelming.
    </p>
    <p class="last">
      With this site, I want to aim for a more professional-looking page, but
      not like fancy restaurant one. I just wanted it to be more clean and the
      brand to be more consistent. This one will have the nav that is frequently
      used. I'm kind of inspired by the color block concept since red seems to
      be a color related to Korea. On the homepage, there will be a block for
      the image to be in, I want it to like swap out like cards. As for the menu
      page, I want it to have a better layout and hierarchy. The menu is pretty
      long but the texts are too big making the scroll tiresome. I was thinking
      that maybe I could make a clickable tabs section here so only certain
      foods should be displayed.

      For today's journal entry, I wanted to focus on the old Yahoo which is
      something I was super obsessed with when I was 8-9 years of age. So when I
      looked up these pictures of the old Yahoo Messenger and Yahoo itself, it
      made me think about how Yahoo back then was so much more fun and better.
      Or maybe because it gave me the nostalgia, so that's why I think it was
      better back then. I felt it had more characteristic back then, and now
      it's more basic and minimal. It's so interesting how even though the yahoo
      back then was not fancy, but it felt better to me. It shows that having a
      better and cleaner design doesn't always mean good. It's the experience
      that matters. In my case, the reason I really like Yahoo back then was
      because of the avatars and the emoticons. There weren't many messenger
      apps back then which is why Yahoo was enjoyable.

      The topic that I chose for this project is “4 Fashion Trends for 2023.” I
      came upon this topic because I was thinking about a topic that is
      specifically for 2023. While searching this topic came to my mind. Given
      that I like looking at fashion, I thought that this topic would be fun to
      work on. As for the style inspiration, I saw a picture (attached below) in
      a researching article and then it made me connect to scrapbooks which is
      something I’ve been into lately. The collage style is something I haven’t
      done a lot too which is why I thought it would be both fun and challenging
      to me. This style also allows me to be imperfect and have cut-out pictures
      that aren’t perfect. I don’t really have a specific site I’m modeling
      after, just picking up animation inspirations here and there !

      I visited a few websites from the awwwards.com site and the one that
      caught my eyes the most is <a href="http://kprverse.com">kprverse.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      What I really like about this site is how immersive the "scroll
      transition" is. I think the website really does a good job of keeping a
      clean minimal layout, yet at the same time making the site feeling very
      full because of the interactive transition. My screenshots don't quite do
      the justtice of how amazing this site works but here are some screenshots
      of the website!

      By look through this site it makes me think about how I can use image
      frames to draw attention. I also noticed the way the clickable words
      subtle change when you hover your mouse over. I learned that you don't
      have to make your words big in order to tell people that this is click
      able. Because users have used many websites, they just know that words
      that move or change are usually clickable. Also, the placement of the
      clickable words subtlely hints if they are clickable. In my project, I
      also would want to have my clickable words/buttons just subtlely change
      when hovered.
