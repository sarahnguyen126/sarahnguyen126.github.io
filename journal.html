    <p>I visited a few websites from the awwwards.com site and the one that caught
        my eyes the most is <a href="http://kprverse.com">kprverse.com</a></p>
    <p>What I really like about this site is how immersive the "scroll transition"
        is. I think the website really does a good job of keeping a clean minimal
        layout, yet at the same time making the site feeling very full because
        of the interactive transition. My screenshots don't quite do the
        justtice of how amazing this site works but here are some screenshots of
        the website!</p>

    <p>By look through this site it makes me think about how I can use image frames
        to draw attention. I also noticed the way the clickable words subtle change
        when you hover your mouse over. I learned that you don't have to make your
        words big in order to tell people that this is click able. Because users
        have used many websites, they just know that words that move or change 
        are usually clickable. Also, the placement of the clickable words subtlely
        hints if they are clickable. In my project, I also would want to have my
        clickable words/buttons just subtlely change when hovered.
